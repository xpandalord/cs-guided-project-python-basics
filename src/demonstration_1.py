"""
Define a function that transforms a given string into a new string where the
original string was split into strings of a specified size.

For example:
If the input string was this:

"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"

and the specified size was 3, then the return string would be:

"sup erc ali fra gil ist ice xpi ali doc iou s"

The assumptions we are making about our input are the following:

- The input string's length is always greater than zero.
- The string has no spaces.
- The specified size is always a positive integer.
